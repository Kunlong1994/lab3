Before lab on Thursday, read through the [Lab 2 activity](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Alt-Lab-2.-DIY-Arduino), and :

1. DESIGN READING: This is intended to help you understand what it means to design interactive devices, and to understand how to  "sketch interactions": Bill Moggridge, Designing Interactions, [Chapter 1](http://www.designinginteractions.com/downloads/DesigningInteractions_1.pdf) & Bill Verplank [Interaction Design Sketchbook](http://billverplank.com/CiiD/IDSketch.pdf) <== focus on section starting on page 10!

1. ELECTRONICS READING: Scherz Chapter 13 (Microcontrollers), 

1. IDEA GENERATION: The point of the lab is to make your Arduino with one small modification. Emphasis on small. Please come up with 10 ideas of what you could do. They *do not* need to be potential market blockbusters. They *do* need to be things you feel like doing next week. Draw sketches with each of your ideas. 

1. DOCUMENT THE PLAN on either your lab Readme.md or Wiki page, including:
- The board you are hoping to modify
- The additions you are hoping to add
- The software (listed below) you intend on using
