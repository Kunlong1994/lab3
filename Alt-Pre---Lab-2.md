DESIGN READING: This is intended to help you understand what it means to design interactive devices, and to understand how to  "sketch interactions": Bill Moggridge, Designing Interactions, [Chapter 1](http://www.designinginteractions.com/downloads/DesigningInteractions_1.pdf) & Bill Verplank [Interaction Design Sketchbook](http://billverplank.com/CiiD/IDSketch.pdf) <== focus on section starting on page 10!

1. IDEA GENERATION: The point of this week's lab is to figure out a cool interaction that you can make possible with the timer capabilities of the micro controller.  You could make a game where people have to try to press a button more times than their friend in a certain amount of time. You could make something that sings you to sleep, and gets quieter and quieter over 3 minutes. You could make something that you hit as you start to run down a hall, and then hit again, to see how fast you can run. 

Please come up with 10 ideas of what you could do. They *do not* need to be potential market blockbusters. They *do* need to be things you feel like doing next week. Draw sketches with each of your ideas.
