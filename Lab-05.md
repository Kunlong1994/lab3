# Integrated Interactive Device

***

For this week’s lab, you will design and build an autonomous device that incorporates:

* Physical Fabrication
* Actuation
* Sensing/Input
* Timing
* Sound

As a guide, we have included instructions to get you most of the way through designing a Jack-in-a-Box. Feel free to explore alternatives to the basic design. For example, if you turn the box on its side, you could have a mouse trap, or a cat door. 


## In the report
Show photos and a video of your final design in action.

Include your sketches and designs for your device, including for ideas you didn't pursue this time.

** include a photo of your box and servo mount **

## Make the service panel for your box. 

** include a photo of your box closed  **

** include a photo of your arm design  **

I used a rubber band for the "arm". The band was fixed on the lid and the other side on the servo motor, when the power was connected, the motor will start moving and the rubber will come off, which pop open the lid
** include a video of the box opening  **


** include drawings, sketches or links to any part files used for creating Jack   **

** include a video of the finished design   **

For your write up, include:
1.	Your Arduino code.
2.	.stl or .svg files for your Jack — if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.
3.	At least one photo-studio-quality photo of your box closed, and another photo of your box open. 

4.	A video of your box in action.
