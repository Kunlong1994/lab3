Good sources for electronics (please add to the list!):

[Tinkersphere](http://tinkersphere.com) Maybe the only place that you can walk into on Manhattan to buy electronics components. Always playing strange MIDI tunes. Prices insanely good for a Manhattan store--same as online, which makes no sense. Wendy suspects whole venture is funded by secret billionaire who loves hobbyists.

[Digikey](http://digikey.com) Has all the parts you need, but you need to ferret them out from the billions of other parts you don't. Usually ships quickly.

[Mouser](http://mouser.com) Like Digikey, with less parts and better interface.

[Adafruit](https://adafruit.com) Brooklyn's own open-source hobbyist online headquarters. Fantastic online tutorials, parts descriptions, etc. Ships quickly to Manhattan. Everything in the catalogue is something you can use.

[Sparkfun](https://sparkfun.com) I love Sparkfun. They are also a hugely wonderful resource to the online open-source community. Really great online tutorials targeted at a slightly older/more advanced crowd than Adafruit. Board Ships more slowly to Manhattan than Adafruit. Everything in the catalogue is something you can use.
